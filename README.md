# CSS to the Rescue

## Introduction
For the course "CSS to the Rescue" form the minor Web Development, we had to design and develop a website using prebuild HTML components. But like any other project for school, we had quite a few challenges and limitations.

This page had to be developed for a person called Marijn. Marijn only uses his keyboard to navigate through the page, so using your mouse is not allowed. This means the page had to be accessible for keyboard-only users.  

One of the other points was that we were not allowed to use classes or ids for styling elements. This way, we explored the css stuff we didn't know before and overcome everyday css obstacles in different way.

### Navigating through the page
Without your mouse, you can navigate through the page with your tab key. Making things accessible in your page for keyboard is done by [tabindex](https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex).

* `tab`: go forwards
* `tab` + `shift`: go backwards

### The rules
- You're not allowed to use classes or id's for styling, but navigating with id is allowed;
- The website has to be responsive
- You can use scss but only the css file will be judged;
- You **have** to use `display: grid`, flexbox if you want to;
- No JavaScript;
- Use relative units;
- Use custom properties;
- Apply the selected techniques from the book *CSS Secrets* by Lea Verou
